**Building and editing the docs**

We welcome any contributions to our docs!
All markdowns can be found in the [source](source) folder.
If adding a new page, please make sure it is also indexed in [source/index.rst](source/index.rst).
We use [Sphinx documentation generator](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and host our docs using Read the Docs.

You can preview the docs build attached to your PR and/or commits through the Github UI or Read the Docs directly.
For quicker iteration, you can also build the docs locally:

```bash
make docs
```
